Hello Renaat,

Included in this zip file are MOST of the files necessarry to run our game.

You will need to install node and npm in order to run it

once this is done, navigate to the code directory
and use the command "npm install" followed by "npm start"  to run it.

once you have the node server up and running
You then need to open 3 browser windows

on browser window 1, enter localhost:8000/client and the "Play" button.
This window will show the lobby as players join.

browser windows 2 and 3 would ideally be views on a mobile device as certain images
are distorted otherwise, to combat this please shrink these browser windows to roughly
half your screen width.

on browser window 2 and 3, enter localhost:8000/player
enter the game code from browser window 1 and a username for each user,
select a color and press "Join". Once both users are joined press "Start game" on one of them.

The current turn and scores are displayed on window 1, the main screen.

You may now play scrabble!
